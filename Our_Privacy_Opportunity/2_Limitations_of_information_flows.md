# Our Privacy Opportunity

## Goals 

1. Learn about the Copy Problem  
Once you share your data, you stop having control over it, it can be further copied and transferred to yet other third parties. 
2. Learn about the Bundling Problem  
To verify information, you sometimes need extra information, which could be potentially avoided. 
3. Learn about the Recursive Enforcement Problem    
If there is an authority, who is the authority of the authority? 

## #1 The copy problem

Once one copies and transfers data to a third party, the third party is now in control of such data and thus might employ them in a way that benefits or harms the original owner. It is tough to enforce the regulation, there are many settings where there might be no way to know what the third party has done with your data in the end. This problem increases if the third party shares the data with yet another third party.

The entertainment industry uses the Digital Rights Management SW, it prevents your computer from copying files that you do not own. It provides third parties power over your own HW. This, however, will never work according to C. Doctorow. Too invasive, you would need to change the inner workings of all computers in the world.

There is a trade-off for people between the utility of the service and the risk of information misused. This problem resonates with the privacy-transparency trade-off, solutions to the latter ameliorate the copy problem.

**Quiz questions**  

*What is the best definition of "the copy problem"?*  
If I share information with you - I can't control how you use it later

*We need to make data generally harder to copy - so that less private data is shared*  
False, we probably need to make copying data easier for consumers - or at the least protect their current ability. So a general statement that copying should become more difficult is misplaced.

## #2 The bundling problem

It can be difficult to share a certain piece of intended information without also needing to reveal additional information to verify the intended information. E.g., to verify you are older than 18, you need to show your date of birth of your ID, however, one only needs an answer "yes" or "no", however, how is the verifier going to verify that? We would need certified cards for anything. Or when you have a surveillance camera, it is **bundling** a lot of data for just in case a rare event happens, and we hope the other unneeded data is not misused. Another example: Getting data to find patterns also incurs in the bundling problem, you are only interested in the patterns, but the data is sent instead. The bundling problem has another side of the coin, it is sometimes detrimental because certain inspections are not allowed due to the bundle of information that is required to check to answer a question, e.g. is a company developing a harmful product? In the process to answer that question, you reveal the intellectual property that is not harmful as well. Designing IFlows for government accountability is harmed by the bundling problem as well, as revealing processes of e.g. intelligence agencies would incur in revealing how they find out about potential attacks to the citizens.

There are natural bundling problems that could be avoided, and artificial bundling problems that are forced upon you. 


## #3 The recursive enforcement problem

A solution to the previous problems is to make them illegal and that an authority verifies and punishes any misbehavior. However, who is the authority that oversees that the former authority also complies by regulation? The problem is recursive and it is a core old problem in political science. In the digital age, this problem is about data governance, the use of stored data in a machine must be monitored and punished in case of misuse. Regulations and pledges are used nowadays but ultimately are difficult to enforce. In political science, there are solutions like democracy, a decentralized system that elects the authorities by consensus. In data however it is tough, as it usually stays in one place.
