### Notes on the course intro [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdfpXIyY9iY&feature=youtu.be)

In order for privacy to be adopted without the force of a regulation or activism, we do not only need to know how the PETs fit together, but also where are the business use cases such that privacy becomes a "hard core competetitve advantage", i.e. susch that the any business in the world would naturally choose PETs above non-private approaches.

PETs streamline and change how organizations collaborate with data that is owned by multiple organizations.
