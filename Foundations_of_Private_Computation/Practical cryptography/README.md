## Discrete logarithm problem

The discrete logarithm problem is the problem of finding ùë¶ knowing ùë•, ùëù (prime) and ùëî (generator for the group of ùëù) such that:

x = g^y (mod p)

While a normal y = log_b(x) looks like:

This x = g^y (mod p) looks like:

Finding y is tough.
**The larger the prime p, the tougher it gets to predict y. We use a generator because then y could be any number between 1 and p-1. y could be larger but because of mod p you only need a number less than p to make g multiply itself with the mod product so that it generates all the values of x between 1 and p-1. x is the randomly chosen secret key between 1 and p-1. **

You can try to crack what the value of y is based on (x, g, p). 

The concrete approach definition for computational security: A scheme is (t, e) secure if any adversary running at most during time t succeeds to break the code within probability at most e. Say a supercomputer can do c key test per unit time, then at time t he will have run c*t checks. The probability of guessing the key of length n bits is

p(c,t,n) = ct/2^n

This probability has to be smaller than e so that the scheme is (t, e) secure. Recall that as the size of the key (n) grows the probability decreases exponentially so comparing we need a lot of time (because it grows linearly) to get to the same probability.

## Linear congruential generation

A linear congruential generator (LCG) is an algorithm that yields a sequence of pseudo-randomized numbers calculated with a discontinuous piecewise linear equation.

## Bits, bytes...

There is a whole section on bity and bytes and encoding

## Stream sipher

Just to show:   
We encrypt a message of N bytes into another of N bytes.
We pad (or XOR) each byte with a secret key to get the cipher text.
I think they use XOR for the shift because you have a 50/50 chance of beocoming 0 or 1 if tge secret key is a random sequence of bits. AND and OR gates are skewed to 75/25. Plues, XOR is complementary.

So far, the cipher we coded pads bit by bit or, equivalently byte by byte, this is what we know as stream cipher because we generate a stream of bytes to pad the message.

In reality, it is more complicated.
