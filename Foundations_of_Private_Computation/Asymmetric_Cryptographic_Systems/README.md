# Asymmetric Cryptographic Systems

## RSA

Public key cryptography = asymmetric cryptography. RSA is the de factor algorithm
There are two keys, one for encrypting and one for decrypting.

In symmetric encryption, there is only one key which must be exchanged between two parties, this means that for N parties to communicate with each other, there is a need for N(N-1)/2 keys.
From the perspective of an entity, the entitiy communicates with N-1 other entities. There are N entities, so there are N*(N-1) connections. For each pair of connections, we only need one key, so that is why we divide by 2.


Other asymmetric key cryptosystems are Paillier and ElGamal.
